Atomic Structure
- Atoms are the basic units of matter
- Protons have positive charge and are found in the nucleus
- Electrons orbit the nucleus in energy levels
- The atomic number is the number of protons in an atom

Chemical Bonding
- Ionic bonds form between metals and non-metals
- Covalent bonds involve sharing of electrons
- Hydrogen bonds are relatively weak intermolecular forces
- Van der Waals forces exist between all molecules
